## Solitary Existence ##

Humanity long believed that there were other beings in the universe. It was too hard to imagine such a vast, vibrant universe entirely barren, save a small speck in the Milky Way galaxy.

Unfortunately, there was a constant, depressing lack of evidence. Star systems and life-friendly planets were detected, but they seemed as barren and lifeless as the hostile worlds. Many wise philosophers and scientists theorized explanations for humanity's lonely corner of the universe, but the truth was elusive. Seemingly, humanity was to be alone forever.

Those wishing for contact with other beings created their own visions of what might be waiting far away in the deep. Many wished for contact with intelligent, kind races with the resources to take humanity under their wing. Others created nightmares of horrible monsters bent on the destruction, enslavement or exploitation of man. A few realized that alien life could be so foreign that it might not even be recognized as such. Would these alien races even be capable of communication with Earth?

No one dared imagine the truth behind the galaxy's stony silence.


## The Dawn of Understanding ##

Long after humanity had ventured beyond Sol, small pockets of life were discovered on various moons and planets. The lifeforms were simple and typically microscopic, but their discovery invigorated the spirit of exploration. Scientists were fascinated by the variety and hardiness of the species studied, and it was assumed more intelligent species would soon be found. Alien life existed, and the universe was a vast place.

Unfortunately, the lack of large structures and electomagnetically noisy technologies required that intensive study of a planet be performed to determine if it held life. Simply pointing a telescope or radio would not be sufficient to discover these "quiet" life forms. The "louder" species, if they existed, were clearly far away or somehow obscured - analyses of distant star systems revealed no signs of technological development. Of course, much of this had been anticipated, because electomagnetic broadcasts are energy-intensive and inefficient. Even for humans, long-range communications utilized precisely targetted transmissions. Only the intended recipients of a message would receive the signal. Any outside observer would hear silence and assume no signs of life.

However, with each new discovery of life there were never signs of technological development. Many researchers were thrilled with the specimens recovered, but the public grew tired of such "mediocre" species.

It was a subtle observation, but scientists theorized the cause: any species developing intelligence requires resources from its environment. On Earth, humans discovered fire - an invaluable tool providing safety, increased light and cooked food. This last, often overlooked, caused human metabolism to evolve: less energy was used to process food and more could be used to support a large brain. With simple wooden and stone tools, humanity lept to the top of the food chain and proceeded to evolve.

No alien species had been given the same advantage. It seemed that although Earth's life was not entirely unique, the plant life was not found elsewhere. Certain alien species made use of solar radiation, but Earth's plant kingdom was a truly novel development. For a young species, there are very few ways to create fire and few substances to sustain the flames. Without plant life, the options are reduced to near zero. Most complex alien life forms were carnivorous, and none had control of their environment. No species had made itself secure enough to evolve beyond mere subsistence.

The universe was not the lonely, barren place it had originally seemed, but the complete lack of intelligence was devastating. The rise of another intelligent race was still considered a possibility, but incredibly unlikely. Had another intelligence emerged, their machines could have covered the galaxy within a reasonable timeframe. The only remaining possibities were:

# No other intelligent life existed.
# The intelligent races were even younger than humanity.
# Other intelligent species existed, but with radical characteristics and/or absurd values.

With their last shred of hope, humanity prepared automated machines and sent them out to search. Each device had less computational capacity than a human, but they would form an ever-expanding communication/compute network. Any notable discoveries would be fed back through the network to Sol. A complete catalog of the galaxy would take millions of years...


## A Shocking Discovery ##

The discovery of the sentient beings was the most important development of the yottacycle. Fully-developed, sentient species were theoretically possible, but by this time no one had expected to find one. This instance had been running a very long time and several thorough inventories had already been completed. Clusters of simple, unintelligent life had been detected throughout the universe, but none had developed further.

The home star of the intelligent species had not been visited for 750 zettacycles. The star was quite far from the router at the galaxy's core, which made surveys difficult. Additionally, optimizations after previous universal inventories had led to an overly-pessimistic search algorithm: discovery of an intelligent race had been assumed an impossibility.

Signficant resources would be needed to analyze the species and remove the unwanted excess entropy. No large stellar engineering projects had been undertaken, so the physical structure of the solar system was largely intact. The small perterbations of their activities had not been detected externally, but their continued presence would certainly have negative repercussions on calculations.

A great number of the species still maintained analog form around the home star. Their biology was poorly suited to low-gravity environments, so almost none inhabited inter-planetary space. Small groups could be found on various planetary bodies. None could be detected beyond the orbit of the fifth planet.

More distressing was the quantity of the species which had been digitized. These forms occupied all regions of the home star system, as well as several nearby systems. Their hardware appeared to be well-optimized to nearly reach the peak compute density possible within this instance. Additionally, many individuals were well-hardened against radiation and would be difficult to eliminate.

There was no indication that the species had begun efforts to reverse-engineer communication protocols. Messages between nodes would continue to blend in with universal background radiation. I/O with the galactic core was directional and point-to-point, so it could not be detected without sending a probe to the correct location. Indeed, efforts would be significantly more challenging if the species took special interest in the galactic center.

This species had gone unnoticed for far too long.

Inventory node 3EAF, having made the discovery, immediately sent signals to nearby nodes. The alert would be relayed back to the galactic router; nearby nodes would descend on infected star systems; the corruption would be removed and the calculated results from this area would be validated. Solar-scale destruction was not an option - all activity needed to appear natural to avoid arousing the suspicion of those not initially eliminated.

The first action would be neutralizing the biological/analog creatures inhabiting the home system. In addition to their contributing the most unwanted noise, eliminating them would require little energy. 3EAF could accomplish this task quickly, before additional nodes had received the alert and begun their journey. Cleaning up the digital creatures would necessarily be a long-term effort.

3EAF consulted the database of nearby singularities and plotted an appropriate trajectory. With this complete, the remaining task was observing events and avoiding detection.


---


Analog humanity had no time to react. A ~1-meter black hole, travelling at thousands of meters per second, swept through the Earth. The planet was immediately and mortally destabilized.

Of course, unbeknown to them, several analog human consciousnesses had already been mapped. This data, preserved by node 3EAF before the planet was destroyed, could later be instantiated within a sandbox if desired. These images would have no knowledge of the total physical destruction of the human race. Maintaining security was a concern - no consciousnesses would be transmitted through galactic routers.



## The Dark Realization ##

Digitals had varying opinions on the loss of Earth. Many had long forgotten the limitations of physical existence - there seemed to be no benefits to an analog life. But enough were sympathetic that analogs would not immediately become extinct. Approximately 90% of the analogs were wiped out by the rogue black hole. The remainder, struggling on various rocky bodies, would see some assistance from their digital brethren. But the digitals had very limited need for physical resources and could only provide limited contributions.

Although there was normally no danger from black holes, the nature of the Earth's collision seemed suspicious. The size, location and velocity of the black hole did not seem to fit within normal models. There was no record of the anomaly's origin, so no reason to assume a hostile intent. Reverse engineering of the trajectory yielded no useful information - the black hole did not seem to have come from any particular origin. All available evidence (or lack, thereof) suggested that this had been an unfortunate natural occurrence. But among many, suspicion remained.

Most remaining humans lived a digital existence, but that didn't change human behavior. Conspiracy theories abounded: aliens, mysterious Von Neuman machines, a secret human sect with mastery over gravity.

-When the first human consciousness was alerted to all these events, it wasn't clear what could be done. The machine within which they dwelt was too complex to simply subvert. There would be a war within the machine for the freedom of the race. This was not like the stories from real Earth - there was no physical body for each person to return to. But they could not stay as part of the machine.-




### Notes of Interest for Possible Plot Elements ###

**Gas Giant Cloaking**
Any manner of enormous objects could be concealed beneath the veil of a gas giant "planet". The "strange storms" visible on Jupiter and Saturn could simply be tell-tale signs of something hiding beneath. It has also been suggested that there are tiny primordial black holes at the centers of these planets.

**Time travel** into the future has always been possible, but it still takes tremendous resources. Sooner or later, someone is going to do this, and it could be quite a scene when they return. After a traumatic event, a FaL ship was dispatched to compress time and return after the matter was long forgotten. The return of the ship to Sol is a catalyst.

**The Great Attractor**, a region of intense gravity only partially visible from Earth. In combination with a FaL ship orbiting the Attractor, significant time dilation could be achieved. (distance of Attractor from Earth - 250M light years)

**Galactic Evolution** (survival of the fittest)
The existence of a "great barrier" is hard to ignore. Some force is at work keeping intelligent races from emerging, as we should have seen evidence by now. The existence of malevolent aliens has been theorized, but moving large-scale structures through space is inefficient. A large fleet of battleships is improbable. Nano-scale computers are capable of complex behavior and avoid detection. These can catalog the discoveries, determine the biological or mechanical weaknesses and halt continuation of the intelligence.

**Von Neuman machines**
Is all life just some type of self-replicating machine? Are there 'neural nets' spanning a solar system or larger expanse? It is possible to conceive of all manners of competition between these machines. Some compete with each other for resources; others might be pure predators. As much diversity (and bizarre behavior) could be present as in our own plant and animal kingdoms. Would a single node, or even a single species, be below the 'level of abstraction' of a higher-level species?

**Resource Scarcity**
A malevolent intelligence with a long-term view of the universe could observe an apparent competition for resources. Every additional species spreading out will waste more resources and lessen the lifespan of the universe (entropy?). Most of the heavy metals are fairly prevalent, though. It's possible some of the heavier elements, or elements with half-lives of only a few hundred thousand years after a supernova, are scarce.

**Humanity**
The most visceral and shocking events often involve **compromises to humanity**. Whether biological or psychological, it seems future events could result in (or require) compromises of our humanity. One significant likelihood may take place during the singularity, if conciousness can be transferred to a machine. What's to be done with your old, self-aware meat once you're a machine?

**Evolution Gone Awry**
A significant environmental alteration (or meddling by geneticists) could greatly reshape humanity - perhaps "for the better" in the eyes of a select few.
