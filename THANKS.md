**Battlestar T.U.X. was designed and created by Eliot Eshelman.**


## Credits ##

Some of the greatest thinkers of our time write speculative fiction/science fiction. Not all will come to be, but all will expand your mind. Additionally, I do believe that portions will prepare you for the future - singularity or not. Those below have contributed much to how I envision the future:
  * Vernor Vinge
  * Charles Stross
  * Frederick Pohl
  * Robert Charles Wilson

To read more about my thoughts, including specific recommendations, see my book recommendations: http://www.6by9.net/music-movie-book-recommendations


A few people have further contributed to Battlestar T.U.X. by reporting problems, suggesting various improvements, submitting code or providing images/sounds/music.  Here is a list of these people:
  * **My Wife, Jill**  "You actually made that?  You never finish anything!"
