## Battlestar T.U.X. Game Data ##


### Atomic Element Emission Lines ###
Object properties in game are determined by their chemical make-up.  Their behavior when they are energized is mostly determined by the emission lines of their atoms.  Appearance may also be determined here, as many elements emit visible light when they are energized.

#  #
element\_emission
| **Column Name** | **Description** | **Data Type** |
|:----------------|:----------------|:--------------|
| atomic\_number  | Atomic Number of Element (number of protons) | tinyint(1)    |
| wavelength      | Wavelength of electomagnetic emissions when energized (nanometers). | float         |
| intensity       | Strength of emissions at this wavelength (relative value [0-1000]). | float         |
| attributes      | Special features of emission wavelength, if any. | tinyint(1)    |


### Atomic Elements ###
Chemical and physical properties of objects are determined by the atomic elements in them.When new objects are created, most of their characteristics will be based on the data here.
